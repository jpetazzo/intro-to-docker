# Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Your training Virtual Machine

## Objectives

In this section, we will see how to use your training Virtual Machine.

If you are following this course as part of an official Docker training
or workshop, you have been given credentials to connect to your own
private Docker VM.

If you are following this course on your own, without access to an
official training Virtual Machine, just skip this lesson, and check
"Installing Docker" instead.
