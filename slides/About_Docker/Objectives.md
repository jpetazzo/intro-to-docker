# Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Docker 30,000ft overview

## Objectives

In this lesson, we will learn about:

* Why containers (non-technical elevator pitch)
* Why containers (technical elevator pitch)
* How Docker helps us to build, ship, and run
* The history of containers

We won't actually run Docker or containers in this chapter (yet!).

Don't worry, we will get to that fast enough!
